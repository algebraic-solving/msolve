If you are working with the git repository
==========================================
You will need to have autotools installed on your system.
1. Run `./autogen.sh` which generates configure and the Makefiles.
2. Run `./configure` (possibly with options, see `./configure -h` for
   more information).
3. Run `make` (possibly with CFLAGS and LDFLAGS adjusted).
4. Run `make check`.
5. Run `make install` in order to globally install the library and the binary
   of msolve.

If you are working on a distriubtion (downloaded *.tar.gz)
==========================================================
1. Run `./configure` (possibly with options, see ./configure -help for more
   information).
2. Run `make` (possibly with CFLAGS and LDFLAGS adjusted).
3. Run `make check`.
4. Run `make install` in order to globally install the library and the binary
   of msolve.

NOTE TO MAC OS users
====================
To build a static binary file, you may need to run `./configure -static`.

You may also need to proceed slightly differently by modifying the `Makefile` file as follows
- add to the `LIBS` variable the `-fopenmp` option
```
LIBS = -lflint -lmpfr -lgmp -lm -fopenmp
```
- change the `CC` variable to your actual `gcc` compiler, e.g. 
```
CC = gcc-11
```
since `gcc` seems to be linked to `clang`.

If you want to generate a distribution
======================================
Run `make dist`.

If you want to generate a static binary
=======================================
Add `-all-static` to your LDFLAGS as follows `make LDFLAGS="-all-static"`.
